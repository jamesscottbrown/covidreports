# COVID Report indexes

This repository files contain files indexing reports influencing documents informing the UK Government's COVID-19 policy.

The indexed files are obtained from:

* the [Scientific evidence supporting the government response to coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/scientific-evidence-supporting-the-government-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19) Collection page on GOV.UK, and the monthly pages of *Meeting minutes and supporting papers* that this links to
* [this folder](https://app.box.com/s/3lkcbxepqixkg4mv640dpvvg978ixjtf/folder/103551854721) of NERVTAG minutes  

The files are:

* `indexes/files.json`: a list of files, including the name and date of the associated meeting
* `indexes/topics.csv` lists the agenda items extracted from the SAGE minutes (after removal of routine items such as the list of attendees, situation summary, summary of agreed actions, items for the next meeting)


The gov.uk page for many of the documents includes a warning message:

> This evidence was often complied very rapidly during a fast-moving response and should be viewed in this context.
> The paper presented here is the best assessment of the evidence at the time of writing, and the conclusions were formed on this basis.
> As new evidence or data emerges, SAGE updates its advice accordingly.
> Therefore, some of the information in this paper may have been superseded at a later date.
